# Facial Recognition using MATLAB

## Overview
This project implements a **facial recognition system** using MATLAB. It consists of three main stages:
1. **Image Acquisition & Database Creation** – Capturing and storing images.
2. **Model Training & Computation** – Applying classifiers and training models.
3. **Real-Time Recognition** – Processing live camera feed and displaying results.

## Features
- Captures and stores images for facial recognition training.
- Utilizes **feature extraction** and **classification models** for face recognition.
- Real-time face recognition via a live camera feed.
- Displays recognition results dynamically below the detected face.

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB (Image Processing & Computer Vision Toolbox)
- Machine Learning Classifiers (SVM, KNN, PCA-based models)
- Haar Cascade for face detection

## Installation
1. **Install MATLAB** with Image Processing and Computer Vision Toolboxes.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Recognition-MATLAB.git
   cd Facial-Recognition-MATLAB
   ```
3. Run the scripts in MATLAB in order:
   - **Step 1:** `image_capture.m`
   - **Step 2:** `model_training.m`
   - **Step 3:** `real_time_recognition.m`


## Future Enhancements
- Implement **deep learning-based face recognition (CNNs)**.
- Improve **real-time processing speed** with optimized MATLAB functions.
- Add **facial expression recognition** for emotion detection.
